# Nemo's Adventure

## Introduction
Dive into an underwater adventure where survival is key! In this vibrant sea, 
you're a small fish named NEMO, navigating through a world where size matters. 
Your goal is to eat smaller fish to grow bigger and stronger. But beware, 
the ocean is vast and full of dangers! Along your journey, you'll discover
hidden treasures that can grant you extra lives and even the chance to call 
upon friends for assistance. Are you ready to embark on this exciting quest 
for survival and growth? Let the journey begin!

## How to Play

### Nemo:
1. Control Nemo using the arrow keys. When no key is pressed, Nemo moves at a
slower speed.
2. Nemo can only eat smaller fish. Be cautious around larger fish as they can 
eat you!
3. Nemo grows bigger and stronger after consuming a certain number of fish, 
regardless of their size. However, upon dying or advancing to the next level, 
you must start growing from the beginning again.
4. Keep an eye out for treasures during your adventure. Consuming these treasures 
will aid you. But beware, some items in the sea are dangerous.

### Enemy Fish
There are four types of enemy fish: red, blue, yellow, and black, each progressively 
larger. Smaller fish can swim faster, but beware of the black shark â€“ it's fast and 
can eat you regardless of your size.

### Fish Warrior
The Fish Warrior is your ally. Each time you eat a star, a Fish Warrior appears to 
protect you. They can even defeat sharks! However, bombs can destroy your Fish Warrior
ally.

### Heart
The heart is a treasure in the sea. Eating it increases your lives. You can have 
a maximum of 5 lives. If your lives are already at maximum, a heart will instead 
add a significant number of points to your current level.

### Star
The star is another sea treasure. Consuming a star summons the Fish Warrior to 
assist you. Try to eat as many as possible!

### Bomb
Bombs are hazardous! They can eliminate you regardless of your size and can also 
destroy your Fish Warrior ally. Stay away from them. Luckily, they don't appear 
too close to you initially.
